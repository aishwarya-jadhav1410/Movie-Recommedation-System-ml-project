# Movie Recommendation System

A Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.

## Overview

This project aims to provide movie recommendations based on user preferences using data preprocessing techniques and recommendation algorithms. The system analyzes user behavior and movie features to suggest movies that align with the user's interests.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Cleaning and transforming raw data into a usable format.
  - Handling missing values, normalization.
  - import ast laibrary & join columns create new_df.
  - apply lambda method
  - remove stop words
  
- **Recommendation Algorithm:**
  - Collaborative filtering (user-based and item-based).
  - Content-based filtering.
  - Hybrid approaches to combine different methods.
  
- **Evaluation:**
  - Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, precision, recall, etc.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
